Please note:

1. I am only after markets with BTC (bitcoin) in it. So everything such as:
LTC-BTC, NMC-BTC, BC-BTC, PPC-BTC

Anything that does not have BTC in it, I don't require.

2. Anything that is XBT means it is BTC. I think Kraken uses XBT as its symbol for BTC.

3. A few sites has it the other way around - they have BTC-LTC, which means the same thing as LTC-BTC (LTC in terms of BTC).
I require the BTC to always be the 2nd pair e.g. BTC-LTC will equal LTC-BTC, BTC-NMC will equal NMC-BTC.

If unsure of anything, please let me know. If you have some ideas, I'd be happy to discuss.

You can also read up a bit on BTC (bitcoin) for your knowledge only.

Thanks.
