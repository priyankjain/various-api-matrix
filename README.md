I'm looking for an experienced coder to create a site that is able to extract API data from 8 different sites that have similar API outputs. 
The data is then able to be combined and outputted when a query is selected.

e.g. 
SiteA displays AUD/USD = 0.920, JPY/USD = 0.010, CNY/USD = 0.160.
SiteB displays AUD/USD = 0.919, JPY/USD = 0.0095, CNY/USD = 0.164, 
SiteC displays AUD/USD = 0.930

What this program can do is, when I select AUD/USD as a query option, it will display:
SiteA: 0.920
SiteB: 0.919
SiteC: 0.930

If I select JPY/USD as a query option, it will display:
SiteA: 0.010
SiteB: 0.0095

If I select ALL currency pairs, it will display in a matrix:
AUD/USD JPY/USD CNY/USD
SiteA: 0.920 0.010 0.160
SiteB: 0.919 0.0095 0.164
SiteC: 0.930

(The site won't be getting data from forex sites, the above is just an example.)

-->The web GUI can be an interface that looks nice, simple and smooth but nothing fancy. Javascript or html5 may be able to achieve this.
-->There should be an auto-load option, where the user can click 'refresh' or have a timer to refresh once per 30 seconds to download all the data to local server, and then run faster queries from there. It is important to have the data refresh often, once per 30 seconds.
-->The user will be able to choose which currency pairs he wants to view from all sites. The user can also choose to view all pairs, then the display will be like a matrix, where the y-axis is a list of 8 sites, and the x-axis is the list of currencies.

The purpose of this application is to have a timely and relevant view of all the different prices in currencies pairs across the 8 sites.

In application, please:
1. state briefly your experience in software development, and 
2. provide your suggestion of the solution in a bit more detail and if javascript or html5 can be used (shows your understanding of the type of project we are doing)
3. [Please DO NOT provide links to past work.]

The code will be deployed on my web server, after you work on your personal server. I will provide the 8 sites and API details if you are a shortlisted candidate. Should be a simple job as APIs are similar and outputs easy to follow.

(If you are the right freelancer for the job, I am looking to build this into an Android App and release to the marketplace after the web version.)
